# React / JSX Template Engine Demo

This repository contains a simple demo of how to use React / JSX as a template engine with Node / Express.

In addition, [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is used to add client-side interactivity.

I explain how this project & setup works in [this video](https://youtu.be/RUoZ2XBa_tw).
